REPLIT

github link: https://github.com/lvvorovi/clients-repl.git

I need an application that will visually look like the one you have built previously.

Business needs:
- clients can use search bar can search for spare part number. Response from api call to the server should be shown in the popup at the bottom right.
- clients can open Requests Page
- clients can open Orders Page
- clients can open Invoices Page
- clients can open Items In Process Page
- client can open Reclamation Page
- All pages should be opened via button, that is located in the vertical menu bar placed on the left
- Above each page view there should be a header bar, width of all the size of window. Right side of the bar should have a drop down menu that will have a text of the client name, when opened - show following buttons: log-out. Left side of the bar should have a name of the page.
- Requests page should have: second line of: 
	- button 'New Request'
	- drop down menu 'Status Filter' that will filter requests by the chosen status
- Requests page should have table showing list of requests. it should look like the example you provided in the previous application you built for me.
- When 'New Request' clicked, New Request Page should be opened. It should allow adding items to the request providing part-number, brand, quantity.
- New Request Page should have button "Place Order".

the rest of business needs will be decided and communicated later.
